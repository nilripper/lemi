# The Schur-Cohn criterion for monic degree-two polynomials

This file is standalone: it imports only Mathlib and shares no declarations
with the rest of the project, so it can be checked in isolation (US-10).

For a monic real quadratic `z² + a₁·z + a₂`, the two Schur-Cohn / Jury
conditions

* `|a₂| < 1`
* `|a₁| < 1 + a₂`

are sufficient for every root to lie strictly inside the unit disk
(`‖z‖ < 1`). The proof follows the discriminant case split:

* `schur_cohn_complex_case`: a non-real root (negative discriminant) comes
  with its complex conjugate; their product is the constant term `a₂`, so by
  Vieta `‖z‖² = a₂ < 1`.
* `schur_cohn_real_case`: a real root (non-negative discriminant) is handled
  together with the companion root via the sign of `p(1)` and `p(-1)`.
* `schur_cohn_degree2`: the main theorem, dispatching on whether the root is
  real.

/-- **Complex (non-real) case.** A non-real root `z` of the monic real
quadratic `z² + a₁·z + a₂` satisfies `‖z‖ < 1` whenever `|a₂| < 1`.

The conjugate `conj z` is also a root, and it is distinct from `z` because
`z` is not real. Subtracting the two root equations gives the Vieta sum
`z + conj z = -a₁`, and substituting back gives the product
`z · conj z = a₂`. Since `z · conj z = ‖z‖²`, we get `‖z‖² = a₂ < 1`. -/

/-- **Real case.** A real root `x` of `x² + a₁·x + a₂` satisfies `|x| < 1`
whenever `|a₂| < 1` and `|a₁| < 1 + a₂`.

Writing `s = -a₁ - x` for the companion root (so `x + s = -a₁` and
`x · s = a₂`), the hypotheses give `p(1) = (1-x)(1-s) > 0` and
`p(-1) = (1+x)(1+s) > 0`; their product is `(1-x²)(1-s²) > 0`. Combined with
`(x·s)² = a₂² < 1` this forces `x² < 1`. -/
